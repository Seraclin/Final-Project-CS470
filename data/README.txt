This contains instructions on how to run our code on the Citi Bike data

For clustering, please ensure that the data and the Jupyter notebook file are in the same directory and run the preprocessing2.ipynb Jupyter notebook 

For PageRank, please ensure the data and the python file are in the same directory. Then type the following into a terminal window python3 pageRankCitiBike.py graph_type output_file_name, where graph_type is either "digraph" or "multidigraph" and output_file_name is the a file name of your choice inputted in the following format "outputfilename.csv" 

For our second implementation of PageRank, please ensure that you navigate to "PageRankImp2", and run "python main.py".

To create .dot file, please ensure the data and the python file are in the same directory. Then run the following code: python3 make_dot_graphs.py graph_type, where graph type is either "digraph" or "multidigraph". These files will be used as input into the MMD version of PageRank.
